# BlackJack

In this project, we’ve explored implementing a simplified version of the well-known game
of BlackJack in 4 different languages: C++, Scala, Java, Python. We’ve also developed
elaborate test cases to validate different scenarios that might occur in a game of BlackJack,
using Mock in Python, JUnit in Java and FreeSpec in Scala. We then compared the lines of
code, challenges we faced, performance analysis of running the program via command line
and running test cases for each of the 4 languages.

Running our code:

Python: All packages we’ve used, comes with the standard python3 installation.
To run the main program, type ”python main.py” (”python3 main.py” if python3 is not
your default python interpreter) in the terminal.
To run the tests, type ”python tests.py” (”python3 tests.py” if python3 is not your default
python interpreter) in the terminal.

Java: We used IntelliJ IDE to run the program and the JUnit tests. Please install all
necessary jar files needed to run the JUnit tests.
To run the main program, type ”javac Main.java” to compile, and ”java Main” to run the
program
We used the IDE to run the tests, but if you want to run it from the terminal, please follow
the steps mentioned in this link.

Scala: Installation of JVM and sbt is required to run the main program and the tests.
To run the main program, type ”cd /BlackJack/BlackJack Scala/src/main/scala/BlackJack Scala
scalac -classpath classes Game.scala” to compile, and ”scala Game” to run the program
To run the tests, type ”cd /BlackJack/BlackJack Scala/” and then type ”sbt test” which
will run all the tests.

C++:
To run the main program, type ”g++ -o game main.cpp” to compile and run the executable
file that’s created by typing ”./game”
To run the tests, type ”g++ -o test Testrun.cpp” to compile and run the executable file
that’s created by typing ”./test”
